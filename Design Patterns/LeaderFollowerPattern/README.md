The Leader-Follower Pattern design pattern is used to efficiently manage threads that handle multiple tasks. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where tasks can be handled by multiple threads, but there needs to be a coordination mechanism to ensure that tasks are evenly distributed and handled efficiently.

Leader: This thread is responsible for accepting new tasks and distributing them to the followers.
Followers: These threads perform the actual task processing.
Task Queue: A queue where tasks are placed by the leader and picked up by the followers.
