Thread-Specific Storage (TSS) Pattern The Thread-Specific Storage pattern is used to create variables that are local to a thread but accessible globally within that thread. This is useful when different threads need to maintain their own version of a variable without interfering with each other. 

In Java, the ThreadLocal class implements the Thread-Specific Storage pattern. Conceptually, you can think of a ThreadLocal<T> variable as a map that contains a separate copy of the variable for each thread, equivalent to a Map<Thread, T>. This map allows each thread to access its own unique instance of the variable.

When a thread completes its execution, the ThreadLocal variables associated with that thread are no longer needed. The ThreadLocal values are cleaned up and will eventually be garbage collected if there are no other references to them.
